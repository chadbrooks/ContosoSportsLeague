Overview

The modern cloud apps hackathon is an all-day hands-on exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, scale, and DevOps using various components of Microsoft Azure.  The hackathon can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended you pair up with other members at the hackathon to more closely model a real world experience and to allow each member to share her expertise for the overall solution.
